`SSTMap` implements two approaches for mapping water structure and thermodynamics on to solute surfaces, such as protein binding sites, the hydration site analysis (HSA) and Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST). The command lines to run each of these analyses are simply `run_hsa` and `run_gist` which are the main command-line tools in `SSTMap`. Here we provide examples of the command line arguments required to run these analyses with different popular MD packages.

A detailed list of command-line arguments for these programs and the MD trajectory requirements can be found at the bottom of this page.  For a detailed description of the output genrated by these programs, see this [post](http://sstmap.org/2017/05/09/undestanding-output/). 
### Amber
```bash
$ run_hsa -i testcase.prmtop -t md100ps.nc -l ligand.pdb -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase

$ run_gist -i testcase.prmtop -t md100ps.nc -l ligand.pdb -g 20 20 20 -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase
```
Since amber prmtop file contains both non-bonded parameters and topology information for the system, therefore, you can leave out the `-p` flag, which is used to specify additional parameter files.
### Charmm/NAMD

```
run_hsa -i testcase.psf -t md100ps.dcd -l ligand.pdb -p toppar/ -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase
$ run_gist -i testcase.psf -t md100ps.dcd -l ligand.pdb -g 10 10 10 -p toppar/ -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase
```
An additional `-p` flag is mandatory for Charmm, NAMD, Gromacs in order to obtain the non-bonded parameters for energy calculations. These additional files are required by the underlying `Parmed` parsers. 

NAMD uses the same forcefileds as Charmm so the same input files are valid for NAMD.   

### Gromacs
```
$ run_hsa -i testcase.gro -t md100ps.xtc -l ligand.pdb -p params.top -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase
$ run_gist -i testcase.gro -t md100ps.xtc -l ligand.pdb -p params.top -g 20 20 20 -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase
```
### OpenMM
OpenMM is an MD toolkit that allows running simulations using Amber99SB forcefield or custom forcefields (written as xml file formats as described [here](http://docs.openmm.org/7.1.0/userguide/application.html#creating-force-fields)). Indeed, systems can also be build from coordinates and topology files for Charmm and Gromacs. Depending on which of the three forcefields was used to build the system for the OpenMM simulation, the correspnding `run_hsa` and `run_gist` commands for the packages will be valid.

### Desmond/Others

The desmond `cms` file format, which contains forcefield and topology information for simulations run in Desmond, is not supported by `ParmEd`, the underlying parameter and topology parser program. However, with three additional steps, it is possible to use Desmond simulations for SSTMap calculations.

* <strong>Step 1</strong>: Convert `cms` file into `pdb` file. This can be done in Schrodinger's Maestro or VMD.

* <strong>Step 2</strong>: Convert dtr file into a netcdf file. Although MFTraj allows reading dtr file format but the cross-platform trajectory loaders of mdtraj (e.g., `mdtraj.load()` or `mdtraj.load_frame()`) do not accept dtr file format. Only a specific loader `mdtraj.load_dtr()` is available for this purpose. In SSTMap code, the trajectory reading is only done through MDTraj's cross-platform loaders. As a result, to process Desmond simulation through SSTMap it is necessary to convert them into netcdf format (although alternative format, dcd, xtc, H5 etc could also be used but netcdf is recommended).Th dtr to netcdf conversion can be be done in VMD using a Tcl script or using a Python script that uses MDTraj's dtr loader. An example Tcl script for this purpose `dtr_to_netcdf.tcl` is shown below:

```tcl
mol new input.cms type mae first 0 last -1 step 1 filebonds 1 autobonds 1 waitfor all
mol addfile 1traj/clickme.dtr type dtr first 0 last -1 step 10 filebonds 1 autobonds 1 waitfor all
animate write output.nc beg 1 end -1
```

This cane be run on the command-line as:

```bash
$ vmd -dispdev text -eoftext < dtr_to_netcdf.tcl
```

Similarly, an example Python script for this, `dtr_to_netcdf.py` is given below:

```python
traj = md.load_dtr("traj/clickme.dtr", top=input.pdb)
traj.save_netcdf("converted.nc")
```
* <strong>Step 3</strong>: Finally, extract non-bonded parameters for each atom in the system. This can be done by running an auxiliary Python script provided in SSTMap repository under [scripts](https://github.com/KurtzmanLab/SSTMap/tree/master/sstmap/scripts) folder: `desmond_extract_nbparams.py`. This script uses Schrodinger Suite's Python API to parse cms file and extract non-bonded parameters. In ordder to run this script, make sure $SCHRODINGER enviornment variable is set on your terminal (which is set by default when a Desmond or Schrodinger installation is done.). For example:
```bash
$SCHRODINGER/run desmond_extract_nbparams.py input.cms
```
will generate a text file called `inputcms_nb_parms.txt`. This text file is a $$N \times 3$$ matrix of non-bonded prameters, where N is the number of atoms and three columns correspond to sigma, epsilon and charge parameters for each atom in the system.

Once the convetred pdb file, netcdf file and parameters text file is available, run_hsa ad run_gist can be run as:  
```
$ run_hsa -i testcase.pdb -t md100ps.nc -l ligand.pdb -p params.txt -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase

run_gist -i testcase.pdb -t md100ps.nc -l ligand.pdb -p params.txt -g 20 20 20 -s 0 -f 100 -o testcase
```
This approach is applicable to any MD package that's not supported. SSTMap calculations are feasibale as long as you can convert your topology and trajectory files to suitable format and extract non-bonded paramters for every atom of your system into a text file with the same format as given above. 

## MD Trajectory Requirements for `SSTMap`
SSTMap calculations require an explicit solvent molecular dynamics trajectory with restrained solute. While `SSTMap` is  agnostic of the water model used, however, it has been tested only for `TIP3P`, `TIP4P`, `TIP4P-Ewald`, `TIP5P` and `OPC` models. This list will be updated as we test more water models. Also note that currently only simulation run in orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions are supported. We intend to provide support for non-orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions in future. The simulations can be generated in one of the following packages: [Amber](http://ambermd.org/), [Charmm](https://www.charmm.org), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), [OpenMM](http://openmm.org/) and [Desmond](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_desmond.html). This list is based on simulation packages that are supported by [MDTraj](https://mdtraj.org) and [ParmEd](http://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/html/index.html), both of which are dependecnies of SSTMap. It's however, possible to expand the applicability of SSTMap calculations even beyond these packages, as long as the trajectory and toplogy formats can be converted to those currently supported (See the Desmond example for this apporach).

The arguments supplied for `-i`, `-t` and `-p` flags vary depending on the MD packages used for simulation. For demonstrative purposes, we use input topology and trajectories from a repository of test cases, which is available on [Github](https://github.com/KurtzmanLab/sstmap_test_suite). You can download the full test suite from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hrijgk8n5z12bgi/AABSigcBf9PN_7-Z26VCCPePa?dl=0) (since Github repository doesn't contain trajectory files). For a given platform, `cd` to its sub-directory and run the commands as shown below.
